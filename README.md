# 🐭 Rat in a Maze – Backtracking (Java)

📌 Description
This project implements the classic Rat in a Maze problem using backtracking in Java.
The rat starts at (0,0) and finds all possible paths to reach (n-1,n-1) while avoiding blocked cells.
Along with paths, the program also prints an answer matrix showing the exact route taken.

🛠️ Concepts Used
Backtracking
Recursion
2D Arrays
Path tracking
Java Collections (ArrayList)

🚀 Features
Finds all valid paths
Moves allowed: Up, Down, Left, Right
Prints path strings (e.g., DRDDRR)
Displays answer matrix for each valid path

▶️ How to Run

Clone the repository
Compile the Java file
Run the main method

📤 Sample Output
Answer Matrix:
1 0 0 0
1 1 0 0
0 1 0 0
0 1 1 1

All Paths: [DRDDRR]

🎯 Learning Outcome
Strong understanding of backtracking

How recursion explores multiple paths

Matrix-based path visualization
